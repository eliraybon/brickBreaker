Brick Breaker is quick re-creation of the classic arcade game, using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
The game was programmed with a procedural approach, in an effort to gain a fresh perspective. The code is composed of two 
distinct entities: data, in the form of global variables, and functions. This contrasts with object-oriented programming where
data and functionality are grouped together in classes/objects. 

As someone who has always programmed in an object-oriented style, this was a fun little experiment that allowed me to take a 
step back and really weigh the pros and cons of OOP, as well as learn a bit about other programming paradigms.
